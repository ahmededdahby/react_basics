React does not rerender the component for each state update meaning if we console log after a setstate we will seee the old value of this state batch the updates regroup theme and rerender for performance reasons
(in dev mode)due to strict mode in main.tsx react render eaxh component twice , the 1st render is used for detecting issues , 2nd render used to update the state
#array state control : 
    +adding : use spread operator , new value
    +deleting : use filter 
    +updating a value  : use map
#object state control : 
    +avoid nested array 
    +each state changing give a new instance of the object
    +treat the object as immutable
    +or use immer and treat the array as mutable
